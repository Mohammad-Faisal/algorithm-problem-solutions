## Learnings

- Be aware of indexes being floating number
  Math.floor(number)

- Be careful where you should use set and where you should use array

```
const et = new Set<string>()
```

- Remember that visited graphs are not required always for directional graphs without loop for DFS

- Initialize an array with 0 filled in

```
const vis = new Array(30).fill(0);
```

- javascript array sort

```
numbers = arr.sort((a , b) => a-b)
```
